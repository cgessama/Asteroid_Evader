#Asteroid Evader

This was one of my earliest projects. It is written in C++ and it uses SDL 1.2 for graphics, sound, and input. 

To play, download bin\debug. Run CB_Asteroid_Evader.exe from within the debug folder.

Press A and D to move the ship left and right respectively. coming into contact with any asteroid will destroy your ship. To escape the asteroid field your warp field must completely charge up. If a charged metallic asteroid passes through your warp field it will be discharged completely. Use your pulse cannon to discharge metallic asteroids by clicking on them. Try to escape in the amount of time.
