# Asteroid Evader

This was one of my earliest projects. It is written in C++ and it uses SDL 1.2 for graphics, sound, and input. 

To play, download bin/debug or get it from my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mIoMzV6fO4QgWujGw06_x_DdPHpQD35c?usp=sharing) . Run CB_Asteroid_Evader.exe from within the debug folder.

Press A and D to move the ship left and right respectively. Coming into contact with any asteroid will destroy your ship. To escape, your warp field must be fully charged. If a metallic asteroid with static charge passes through your warp field it will be dissipate completely. Use your pulse cannon to discharge metallic asteroids by clicking on them. Try to escape as quickly as possible.
